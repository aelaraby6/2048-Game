## 📖 The Tale of 2048

In a quiet digital universe, a **mystical grid** was born.  
At first, it was empty… just silence.  
Then, out of nowhere, **a lonely tile appeared: 2**.  

The prophecy said:  
*"Merge the numbers, grow their power, and unlock the legendary 2048 tile."*  
But beware: the grid is small, the space is tight, and one wrong move can end your journey.

## 🧙 The Rules of the Realm
- Use the **Arrow Keys** to shift the forces of the grid.  
- Tiles of the same kind will **unite** into something greater.  
- Every move summons a new tile — sometimes a friend, sometimes chaos.  
- Victory comes when you summon the **2048 tile**
